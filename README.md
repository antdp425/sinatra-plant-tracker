# Eleplant - Never Forget Your Plants Again!
## Keep track of the plants you want, the plants you have and how to take care of them.

### About 
A CRUD app, built on Sinatra. A user has access to a list of the houseplants they own and their care instructions, and to a plant wishlist with the ability to remove from the wishlist and add to their plant list. A User cannot edit or delete another user's plants or wishlist. 

### Install Instructions
Make sure that you're in the app's directory. 
1. Run ```bundle install```.
2. Run ```rake db:migrate```.
3. Feel free to use ```rake db:seed``` or create your own account and lists.
4. Run ```shotgun``` 
5. Type the localhost URL into your browser and start keeping track of your plants.
